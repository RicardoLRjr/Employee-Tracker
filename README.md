# This is the readMe for Employee Tracker.

 ## Project Name:
 Employee Tracker

 ## Description:
 This is a web application that displays a table of information about our employees that allows you to filter employees by characters in their names, and that will also (eventually) allow you to sort by name or by age. This application was entirely  built using react.

 # Installation 
 # Usage

 # Tests 
 # Miscellaneous 

 ## Installation Instructions:
 This application does not require installation, other than running a simple npm install if the user wishes to run it from their own local machine. Otherwise, the app can be used by visiting the included URL. 

 ## Usage Instructions:
 This project is relatively self-explanatory, as the user simply needs to click on the buttons for their actions to take place.

 ## Tests:
 N/A

 ## Miscellaneous:
Known Issues: 
    At the moment, the sort function is disabled, as it breaks the JSON set that is used to display the data and causes the site to fail. However, the project will be updated once that issue has been fixed. 
Directions for Further Development: 
    In the future, I would like to add a page/functionality for a user to send in their own JSON of data so that this utility can be used to directly manage their company's employees.
